# Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) Stage Prediction: An End-to-End ML Pipeline
The goal of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model capable of classifying the histological stage of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) based on clinical and biochemical markers. We will analyze patient data to understand how physiological features change as the disease progresses from Stage 1 to Stage 4.

The main task is to solve a **Multi-class Classification Problem**, where the target variable is the patient's disease `Stage`.
Our performance will be measured by the accuracy and F1-score in correctly identifying the severity of the disease given a patient's blood work and clinical signs.
